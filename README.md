### Welcome to Digital.ai Developer Community for Release and Deploy
This page describes how you can contribute to the [Digital.ai](https://digital.ai/) community plugins, where the continuous integration is located and what steps to follow to release your community plugin.

To join the DigitalAI-community organization, you will need to create a GitHub account, request to join the Digital.ai GitHub organization and execute the Digital.ai Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”). Any Submissions you make to a Digital.ai GitHub organization project or to Digital.ai Software, Inc., its affiliates, assigns and subsidiaries (collectively “Digital.ai”) are subject to the terms of the CLA.  

### Quickstart for Existing Plugins

If you want to contribute to an existing repository, simply fork the repository, make your changes, and send a pull request.
If you need help with this, contact an existing plugin contributor - for example the person who last committed to that repository.

## Project Submission Requirements

1. Submissions must adhere to the coding standards

2. Refer to the Definition of Done. We use these guidelines internally to ensure that we deliver well-tested, well-documented, and solid code. We encourage you to use this as well! 

3. Pull requests (PRs) must be accompanied by a meaningful description of their purpose. Comprehensive descriptions increase the chances that a pull request is merged quickly and without additional clarification requests. 

4. Commits must be accompanied by meaningful commit messages. 

5. PRs that include bug fixes must be accompanied by a step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug. 

6. PRs that include new logic or new features must be submitted along with Unit/integration test coverage. 

7. For large features or changes, open an issue to discuss your proposal first. Notifying us in advance can prevent duplicate or unnecessary effort, and also offers an opportunity to get additional background information and help from other contributors. 

8. To report a bug open an issue. 

9. Verify that all automated tests on your pull request pass successfully.
